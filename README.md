#New Year's Day

Marking the first day of the new year according to the Gregorian calendar, **is not the same everywhere in the world**. While many countries celebrate on January 1st, there are variations based on different calendars and cultural traditions. Here are some factors influencing the differences:

**Calendars:**

* **Lunar calendars:** Some cultures, like China and Vietnam, follow a lunar calendar where New Year falls on a different date each year, usually between late January and mid-February.
* **Other calendars:** Other calendars, like the Hindu calendar, use different starting points and lengths for years, leading to New Year celebrations on diverse dates.

**Time zones:**

* **Global clock differences:** As the Earth rotates, countries welcome the new year at different times due to time zone variations. The first places to celebrate include New Zealand and Samoa, while others join in gradually as it becomes midnight in their respective zones.

**Cultural traditions:**

* **Local New Years:** Some cultures have additional New Year celebrations based on their own historical or religious calendars. For example, the Iranian New Year (Nowruz) falls on the spring equinox, which can be sometime in March.
* **Alternative celebrations:** Other regions may have additional festivities besides January 1st, focusing on specific religious or cultural events around that time.

**Therefore, while many countries share January 1st as New Year's Day, the celebrations, timing, and significance can differ greatly depending on location, calendar system, and cultural traditions.**

**Noteworthy:** 
This is not an exhaustive list, and there are some countries that span both hemispheres. Additionally, some island nations may not be listed individually.

Nigeria straddles both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres! The southernmost point of Nigeria is located just above the equator, around latitude 4°N, while the northernmost point reaches up to roughly latitude 14°N. This places about 8% of Nigeria's landmass in the Northern Hemisphere and 92% in the Southern Hemisphere.

So, Nigeria experiences various seasons depending on the specific location within the country:

* **Southern regions:** Hot and humid tropics with a rainy season from April to October and a dry season from November to March.
* **Central regions:** A blend of savanna and tropical conditions with distinct wet and dry seasons.
* **Northern regions:** Hot and dry with a shorter rainy season from June to September and a longer dry season.

While the majority of Nigeria lies in the Southern Hemisphere, understanding its landmass distribution across both hemispheres helps explain the diverse climatic patterns and landscapes experienced throughout the country.
