**Noteworthy:** 
This is not an exhaustive list, and there are some countries that span both hemispheres. Additionally, some island nations may not be listed individually.

Nigeria straddles both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres! The southernmost point of Nigeria is located just above the equator, around latitude 4°N, while the northernmost point reaches up to roughly latitude 14°N. This places about 8% of Nigeria's landmass in the Northern Hemisphere and 92% in the Southern Hemisphere.

So, Nigeria experiences various seasons depending on the specific location within the country:

* **Southern regions:** Hot and humid tropics with a rainy season from April to October and a dry season from November to March.
* **Central regions:** A blend of savanna and tropical conditions with distinct wet and dry seasons.
* **Northern regions:** Hot and dry with a shorter rainy season from June to September and a longer dry season.

While the majority of Nigeria lies in the Southern Hemisphere, understanding its landmass distribution across both hemispheres helps explain the diverse climatic patterns and landscapes experienced throughout the country.
